* Presentation on teaching Functional Programming to CUNY Undergraduates

The repo contains the materials used for my presentation.  The pdf was created using
org-mode.  To recreate the pdf, after downloading the repo:

1. Find the initialize.org file.  This file contains code for emacs to
   run code in Haskell. Place the cursor between begin and end of source and press
   C-c C-c.
2. Find whyFP.org.  Use the key chord C-c C-e to export.  This creates WhyFP.tex.
3. Find WhyFP.tex.  Press the lion to generate the pdf. Press a second
   time to correct references.  Press the eyeglasses to see the pdf.
